                <h1>Physical Challenges Faced by Older Adults that Impact Performance in e-Learning Courses:</h1>
                <p>Older adults experience many age-related changes that can affect performance in e-Learning courses. These include changes to vision, hearing, motor control, cognition, and mood.</p>
                <p>We have received several reports of older adults experiencing challenges due to these issues in 2015. These reports are detailed in the pie-chart to the left. Hover over each section to see the type of issue reported, and the number of older adults who reported experiencing issues in that area.</p></section>

            <h2>	Unsurprisingly, individuals frequently begin to encounter vision problems as they age. Since e-learning is a primarily visual domain, it is important to be cognizant of the visual issues faced by many members of the population. To accommodate for visual impairments, the following is recommended to e-learning developers:</h2>
            <ul>
<li><h3>incorporate an audio track along with any text or visual elements, so that individuals who have trouble seeing the screen can still grasp important content.
    use high-contrast colors, but avoid colors with short wavelengths (e.g., blue, green).</h3></li>
                <li><h3>use a sans-serif typeface that is at least 12-point in size.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>if possible, incorporate accessibility software that allows users to adjust font size, colors, and other visual elements as they see fit.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>keep interface design minimal, with plenty of whitespace to prevent screen elements from “bleeding together” visually.</h3></li></ul>

            <h2>It is also rather common for older adults to experience difficulties in hearing. While e-learning is not traditionally as heavily rooted in auditory content, most e-learning courses do include narration tracks at least some of the time. To ensure that the needs of individuals with auditory impairments are properly addressed, e-learning developers should avoid including important information in audio tracks that is not also available visually, and incorporate accessibility software for hearing impairments when possible.</h2>

            <h2>Older adults often experience motor control difficulties. The natural deterioration of motor control brought about by the aging process should be considered when designing interactive media for older adults. The following is recommended to developers, in order to accommodate motor control challenges: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>always design clickable elements to be large and spaced far enough apart that an individual who experiences tremors or similar motor impairments do not accidentally click the wrong element.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>avoid complicated user actions like “drag-and-drop” exercises, as these tend to be unintuitive for older adults, and too complicated for individuals with motor impairments to perform accurately.</h3></li></ul>

            <h2> Finally, aging causes a natural decline in cognitive processing abilities. As we age, our abilities to quickly, easily, and accurately process information and perform tasks decline, and our brains become more susceptible to cognitive overload. Users over age 55 are more likely to become confused and disoriented while using interactive media, and are not able to retain information as easily as younger users. To reduce cognitive overload and maximize learning outcomes in older adults, e-learning developers should:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>incorporate regularly-timed review sessions and break information down into smaller, more manageable chunks.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>rely primarily on recognition-based questions (e.g., multiple choice), rather than recall questions (e.g., short answer).</h3></li>
                <li><h3>emphasize the use of cognitive strategies by students as they navigate through a course (e.g., prompts to paraphrase newly-learned content, lists of questions to answer while engaging with a particular course segment).</h3></li>
                <li><h3>employ Gestalt design principles to group related content on the same area of the screen.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>use “segmentation” to break content down into small, meaningful, connected chunks, rather than presenting a plethora of information at once.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>weed out unnecessary information or “filler” content, as well as technical jargon or esoteric language.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>create a clean, minimal interface that is consistent and conforms to standard design practices.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>limit the steps required by users to complete each action.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>incorporate an easily-accessible map or index of course contents, along with breadcrumbs to help users easily find information and remember how they got to a particular page.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>provide signaling tools such as “advance organizers” prior to the start of each course segment, outlining key points so that users are able to identify core content.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>provide plenty of assistance options throughout the course, through the incorporation of help buttons, search bars, FAQ pages, live-chat options, and/or highly trained course administrators.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>present error messages in friendly tones that remove the blame from the user, to prevent confusion, frustration, and learned-helplessness.</h3></li></ul>
